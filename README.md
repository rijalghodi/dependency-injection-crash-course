# Dependency Injection Crash Course - Express JS

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement Inversion of Control (IoC) by injecting dependencies into an object, rather than having the object create them itself. This pattern improves modularity and makes your code easier to test and maintain.

In this crash course, you’ll learn about dependency injection by implementing it in a simple Express application. We’ll explore different levels of DI implementation, from basic principles to more advanced techniques.

## Levels

You can switch between branch to exlore these 4 level of DI understanding:

- Level 1 - Class initialization problem
- Level 2 - Singleton Principle
- Level 3 - Dependency Injection Container
- Level 4 - Dependency Inejction Decorator

## How to Learn?

1. **Explore Levels**
   - Switch between each level by checking out the corresponding branches in the repository.
2. **Read and Understand**
   - Explore the code and read the comments provided in each branch to understand the implementation and the problem it solves.
3. **Run the App**
   - Execute `yarn dev` to run the app. Install Yarn if needed.
4. **Analyze Changes**
   - Think about how each level improves upon the previous one. Review the README files in each branch for detailed explanations and insights.
